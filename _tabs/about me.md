> "Hey look, another Software Engineer that drinks coffee and does rock climbing, how original."

Well, you're not wrong...

Like most people my age, I played a lot of video games growing up... and I mean a lot. And that's what really drove me to Computer Science. When I enjoy something I can't help the urge to understand how it works, and it's lead me to a career I love in Software Engineering. I've always been a problem solver at heart, and I think that really shows in my work and hobbies.

During my time at Leeds University I started bouldering, and quickly fell in love. I'd done plenty of sports before that, but being a sport that's built around solving puzzles, safe to say I've been obsessed since. For those who aren't familiar, being strong isn't the only important factor in rock climbing. You also need to understand the human body, how it works and moves, and then use that understanding to "solve" the climb, it's as much an intellectual challange as a physical one.
